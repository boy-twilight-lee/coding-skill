# CSS Code Rules

These rules are mandatory for changed or reviewed styles; existing code does not waive them. Fix directly affected violations without migrating unrelated styles or markup. Project overrides apply only where a rule permits them; report unavoidable conflicts and keep deviations minimal.

Introduce CSS custom properties or `var(...)` only for a demonstrated need, and verify that referenced properties exist and are supported by the actual library version or runtime.

## Core Rules

1. Prioritize the project's unified stylesheet-preprocessor convention when selecting a language. When modifying an existing component, preserve its original stylesheet language and scoping mechanism rather than migrating it. For a new component, follow the unified project convention first; when no unified convention determines the choice, select Less only if the project already supports Less or no stylesheet preprocessor is installed. If Less is unsupported and another preprocessor is installed, follow the existing supported preference. When no preprocessor is installed, choose Less and establish the required dependency and build support before compiling Less styles.
2. Keep component styles with their owner and ordinary Vue styles scoped. Extract the entire inline style block into one sibling stylesheet when it reaches 80 non-blank lines, or when it has at least four owned selector groups plus any two of these complexity signals: nesting three or more levels deep, three or more state/pseudo-class branches, `:deep(...)` or third-party overrides, keyframes or complex animation, or responsive/supports/container at-rules. These are mandatory extraction triggers, not review suggestions; shorter styles may also be extracted when template coupling or maintenance difficulty justifies it. Never split by visual region. Keep application-wide resets, tokens, utilities, and global library overrides in the established global style area.
3. Give each component a concise, business-qualified root and keep owned selectors beneath it. Concise names and consistent, recognizable business abbreviations are mandatory for project-owned class names to control length; abbreviate multiword and repeated business segments from the start rather than waiting until a name becomes overly long. Remove redundant ownership words, ancestor chains, and meaningless suffixes. Keep short structural and state words readable, follow the project's single-hyphen BEM-like naming, and never use opaque letter strings. Teleported content may have a separate concise, business-qualified root.
4. In nesting-capable styles, mirror the actual DOM parent hierarchy and child order. Do not float child selectors outside their DOM parents or skip intermediate parents to reduce nesting depth. For real component-local reuse, first define a focused non-emitting mixin at the top of the nearest common DOM ancestor selector scope and invoke it from the original nested consumer paths. Put pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes inside their owning element through `&`; group shared conditions before nesting interaction states, following the supplied example. Use `& >` only for a stable direct-child contract and never start a nested selector with bare `>`.
5. In scoped nesting-capable styles, target deep selectors with `&:deep(...)` and consolidate rules under the nearest shared library-owned parent. For native CSS, choose the implementation according to the actual project configuration and browser support; this skill does not prescribe a native-CSS fallback template.
6. Use Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts. Consider Grid only for two-dimensional layouts that require coordinated row and column alignment.
7. This rule applies only to third-party component-library customization. Within that scope, prefer documented library custom properties and ordinary scoped or deep selectors over specificity escalation or `!important`. It imposes no additional customization policy on other business styles.
8. Remove ineffective and redundant declarations. Repeating a value already supplied identically by the matched global reset, inheritance, or browser rules is prohibited, including box-sizing, margin, padding, font-size, font-family, line-height, color, list styling, borders, backgrounds, positioning, and effects. Remove properties inapplicable to the actual layout and declarations unconditionally overwritten without independent effect. Verify the matched element, cascade, and required states; a property that changes the required result is not redundant. This rule covers declaration effectiveness only.
9. Avoid routine style comments. Add only a concise Chinese comment for a non-obvious compatibility workaround, external-library constraint, or temporary exception that structure cannot express.
10. Own blank lines inside all stylesheets and Vue style blocks; apply the whitespace requirements and formatter/linter guidance defined in [Blank Line Examples](references/blank-line-examples.md). Do not apply script or template blank-line conventions to stylesheet interiors.
11. Group properties controlling the same aspect of element presentation contiguously. Follow the supplied example order: positioning and transforms; interaction; dimensions/clipping/fitting; margin/padding; visual appearance; typography; transition/animation; display/layout. Keep transform with positioning, height before width, and transition/animation before display and its flex/grid/alignment/gap properties. Do not interleave categories or add unused properties or comments to complete groups. Keep local mixin definitions at the common DOM owner top, calls at their emitted group, and nested selectors after declarations. Preserve effective cascade and honor active Stylelint order when it explicitly conflicts.
12. Consolidate duplicate selector blocks under their actual DOM owner. Keep related spacing, border, layout, and state declarations together without changing the intended cascade or creating detached child rules.
13. Verify newer style APIs, selectors, units, and properties against the actual browser targets and build tooling. Confirm support or use the repository-approved fallback before introducing them.
14. Format only changed style files, restore unrelated formatter churn without losing pre-existing user edits, and re-check the final diff against all applicable rules. Report checks that cannot be run or fail solely on untouched legacy formatting.

## Required Reference Loading

After repository inspection and before implementation or review decisions, open and fully read every matching reference below, including uncertain matches. Every task must read at least one; if none matches, read the closest. References are mandatory requirements. Mentioning or summarizing a reference does not replace opening and reading it.

- Rule 1: Read [Stylesheet Language Examples](references/stylesheet-language-examples.md) when selecting a preprocessor or preserving an existing component language.
- Rule 2: Read [Style Scope and Extraction Examples](references/style-scope-and-extraction-examples.md) when choosing scope, extracting styles, or placing component and global styles.
- Rule 3: Read [Naming Examples](references/naming-examples.md) when choosing concise business roots, abbreviations, or teleported-root names.
- Rule 4: Read [DOM Nesting and Mixin Examples](references/dom-nesting-examples.md) when following DOM hierarchy/order, placing local mixins, or nesting pseudo/state branches.
- Rule 5: Read [Deep Selector Examples](references/deep-selector-examples.md) when targeting and consolidating scoped component-library deep selectors.
- Rule 6: Read [Layout Examples](references/layout-examples.md) when choosing Flexbox for one dimension or considering Grid for two dimensions.
- Rule 7: Read [Component Library Customization Examples](references/library-customization-examples.md) when customizing third-party component libraries through supported APIs or scoped overrides.
- Rule 8: Read [Ineffective CSS Declaration Examples](references/ineffective-declaration-examples.md) when removing reset/default duplicates, inapplicable properties, or overwritten declarations.
- Rule 9: Read [Style Comment Examples](references/style-comment-examples.md) when deciding whether a compatibility, library-constraint, or temporary-exception comment is needed.
- Rule 10: Read [Blank Line Examples](references/blank-line-examples.md) when writing, reviewing, or formatting stylesheet code, or configuring its tools.
- Rule 11: Read [Property Order Examples](references/property-order-examples.md) when grouping presentation properties or placing declarations and mixin calls.
- Rule 12: Read [Selector Consolidation Examples](references/selector-consolidation-examples.md) when merging duplicate selectors and keeping state changes together under their DOM owner.
- Rule 13: Read [Compatibility Examples](references/compatibility-examples.md) when checking browser/tooling support for new style features or choosing approved fallbacks.
- Rule 14: Read [Formatting and Final Review Examples](references/formatting-and-review-examples.md) when formatting only changed files, restoring unrelated churn, or checking the final diff.

## Working Process

1. Inspect repository instructions, affected markup and components, neighboring styles, resets, preprocessors/PostCSS, browser targets, and check scripts. Base decisions on the actual DOM and active configuration.

2. For Vue style blocks, apply `vue-code-rules`; also apply `ts-code-rules` when changing TypeScript.

3. Review changed lines against applicable rules and checklists. Count inline non-blank style lines, record complexity signals, and perform required extraction. Verify affected visual states when a preview or test exists. Run targeted formatter, lint, build, or tests without rewriting unrelated files. Report unmet rules and unavailable or failed checks; syntax or formatting success alone does not prove correctness.
